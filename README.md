# Trivia Game

Testing your knowledge should always be a fun game, because it makes the user WANT to take part in the quiz instead of the dreaded feeling of them HAVING to. I know we don't get quizzed on the information we've learned from SEI course but it's nice to know if we're able to speak the engineering lingo in the real world.

## User Stories:

(1) Who are the users?

*Coders & Engineer beginners.*

(2) Why are they using the product/service?

*To test their knowledge and to learn basic coding terminologies.*

(3) What are they going to do?

*I'm a huge fan of Jeopardy so it will be in an Answer - Question format to test their knowledge. It will also be a place filled with "fun facts" about coding.*

## Wireframes:
I used a free program Wireframe.cc to create my wireframes. This is to get an idea of how I want my layout to be for the quiz board & multiple choice modal.

## Planning checklist:

I created a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/zqiH9Ljg/ga-project-1-trivia-game) to keep my planning organized with the project tasks, reference links, and due dates. Thanks to my Instructor Assistant for the suggestion, Esin Saribudak :purple_heart:

## Unsolved Problems/Hurdles

It was more user friendly to change the "click" action on the multiple choice radio buttons (shown on wireframe) to "click" the entire multiple choice line item. This way if users are playing on the phone, its easier for them to select answer choice.
