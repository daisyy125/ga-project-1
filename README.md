# Trivia Game

Testing your knowledge should always be a fun game, because it makes the user WANT to take part in the quiz instead of the dreaded feeling of them HAVE to. I know we don't get quizzed on the information we've learned from SEI course but it's nice to know if we're able to speak the engineering lingo in the real world.

## User Stories:

(1) Who are the users?

*Coders & Engineer beginners.*

(2) Why are they using the product/service?

*To test their knowledge and to learn basic coding terminologies.*

(3) What are they going to do?

*I'm a huge fan of Jeopardy so it will be in an Answer - Question format to test their knowledge. It will also be a place filled with "fun facts" about coding.*

## Wireframes:
I used a free program Wireframe.cc to create my wireframes. This is to get an idea of how I want my layout to be for the quiz board & multiple choice modal.
